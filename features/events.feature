Feature: As a site user
  In order to be able to plan activities
  I would like to see event CRUD functionality

  Background:
    Given following events exist:
      | name           | description             | category        | event_date | start_time              | end_time                | repeats | time_zone                  |
      | EuroAsia Scrum | Daily scrum meeting     | Scrum           | 2014/02/03 | 2000-01-01 07:00:00 UTC | 2000-01-01 09:30:00 UTC | never   | London                     |
      | PP Session     | Pair programming on WSO | PairProgramming | 2014/02/11 | 2000-01-01 10:00:00 UTC | 2000-01-01 10:15:00 UTC | never   | Eastern Time (US & Canada) |

  Scenario: Show index of events

    Then I should see "AgileVentures Events"
    And I should see link "New Event"


  Scenario: Render Next Scrum info on landing page
    And I am on the home page
    Then I should see "Scrum"
    And the next event should be in:
      | period | interval |
      | 1      | days     |
      | 21     | hours    |
      | 45     | minutes  |

    And I fill in event field:

      | Description | scrum description |
    And I select "Repeats" to "weekly"
    And I check "Monday"
    And I check "Thursday"
    And I click the "Save" button
    Then I should see "Event Created"
    Then I should be on the Events index page
    Then I should see multiple "Scrum" events
